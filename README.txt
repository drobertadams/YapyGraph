# Python graph representation.

> Robert Adams (d.robert.adams@gmail.com)

The package consists of two files:

1. `Vertex.py` is a class that represents a simple vertex.
2. `Graph.py` is the graph class itself.

Unit tests are located in `tests`. Run `nosetests` to run all the unit tests. NB: There is no unit test for the Vertex class because it's basically a data structure.
